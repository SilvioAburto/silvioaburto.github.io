<p>I enjoy automating labor-intensive lab processes into efficient, user-friendly workflows. I program systems composed of many lab instruments to carry out complex and labor-intensive workflows. I also build software tools in the form of web and desktop apps to help make the day to day easier for laboratory operators. I’m also very interested in data science, I enjoy analyzing data to get better insights and make informed decisions. </p>

I truly enjoy building tools that automate tedious and repetitive tasks with an emphasis on ease of use and customer satisfaction. I would like to join a team where I can continue doing this while learning and expanding my knowledge of software.

**Technologies**

**Experience**

**Science Corporation.** Alameda, CA. **Mar** **2020-Present**

**Senior Automation Engineer,** Automation.

- Building lab automation software to help developer the next generation of brain computer interfaces.

**Amyris Inc.** Emeryville, CA. **Mar** **2020-Nov 2023**

**Senior Automation Engineer,** Automation.

**Automation Engineer 2,** Automation.

**Automation Engineer 1,** Automation.

- Supported essential web apps for the High throughput screening department.
- Built automation web dashboard hosting data for over 20 lab systems. Over 50,000 events have been captured to date and this tool is now essential in our day-to-day troubleshooting and quality control. This web interface has decreased troubleshooting time by half and increases transparency between automation and our user groups.
- Built a ticketing UI that allows operators to easily submit a JIRA ticket, tag a system, attach an error event associated to their request and ultimately track their ticket’s progress and resolution.
- Standardized and developed 10+ drivers written in C# for third party lab instrumentations.
- Contributed to multiple ‘Software Build Cycles/Sprints’ on migrating deprecated Python 2 LIMS to Python 3.
- Migrated deprecated host running a ‘Shiny Server’ instance from old ubuntu server to latest release and fully Dockerized the project, allowing for faster and more robust development and deployment of Amyris’ Shiny apps.
- Built and deployed the C# framework and extensions used by our lab systems to upload robot events to a centralized database table with flexible data storage.
- Built data dashboards for multiple projects.
- Large data manipulation and inferential analysis in R.
- Developed and modified C# plugins and drivers for Green Button Go scheduling software.
- Created and maintained Amyris’ automation C# library. A library that holds classes and methods for all automation shared functionality. Eg. Data uploader, data parsers, plate and well classes, event uploaders, email classes, etc.
- Lead documentation effort across the team. Evaluated different platforms and strongly advocated for better documentation efforts within the team. Ultimately, going from no documentation or ad-hoc documentation to a central documentation site (Confluence).
- Implemented better coding practices across different integrated automation systems.
- Integrated CI Gitlab workflows to our code development pipeline.

**Demetrix.** Berkeley, CA. **Jul 2019-Mar 2020**

**Senior Process Engineer,** High Throughput Process engineering

- Built automated R scripts with analysis and visuals of correlation between plate and tank conditions to find which factors best predict tank performance.
- Wrote sample tracking scripts, data parsers and data visualization tools.
- Contributed to the company’s F# code base in the form of data parsers and sample hierarchy visualization tools.
- Plate model development lead. From DOE, execution, data analysis and communicating findings.
- Mentored and helped fellow scientists on writing Python and R code for data analysis.

**Amyris Inc.** Emeryville, CA. **Sep 2016-Jul 2019**

**Associate Scientist III,** HTS

- Author of multiple web applications that help the day-to-day lab operations. These apps became essential to the day to day of lab operators in the HTS lab.
  - Real Time Process Tracker: This tool led to a significant reduction in processing errors, and an increase in efficiency and transparency among stakeholders.
  - Label generators: removed the need to manually write on samples, decreasing RSI risk and potential human errors.
  - Real time UI that tracks the state of over 18 shakers/incubators using Python Flask.
  - Sample Re-prep web app: Tracks submission of cross-department sample re-prep requests using Python Flask.
  - Process Control Charts: A web UI that allows you to keep track of process control data.
